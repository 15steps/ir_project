                                                 which capacity is right for me?                                                                                                         iphone 7 and iphone 7 plus come in two capacities: 32gb and 128gb. the term “gb“ stands for gigabytes. the more gigabytes you have  the more content you can store on your iphone  such as apps  games  photos  hd videos  music  and movies. if you have a large music or photo library or lots of apps  it’s a good idea to consider an iphone with a larger capacity. if you rarely download apps or you don’t take many photos or videos  an iphone with a smaller capacity may be better for you.                                                                                                  when i buy from apple.com  does my iphone come ready to use?                                                     if you completed the carrier activation steps for at&t  sprint  or verizon when you purchased your new iphone online  it will arrive ready to use. just turn it on and follow the onscreen instructions to set it up. if you chose to skip carrier activation at the time of purchase  you’ll need to insert an active sim card or contact a carrier to set up an account. if you selected an iphone for t-mobile  it will come with the appropriate nano-sim  but you’ll need to contact t-mobile or visit an apple store to activate your iphone. if you selected the sim-free iphone  you’ll need to insert your own nano-sim card or obtain one from the supported carrier of your choice and activate it in order to use your iphone.                                                          which u.s. mobile phone carriers provide iphone service?                                                                                                         at&t  sprint  t‑mobile  and verizon are the national wireless carriers for iphone in the united states. apple.com and the apple store sell iphone models for use on these

                                                                                                     nearly all iphone models sold on apple.com are “unlocked” — which means your iphone isn’t tied to a single carrier. your iphone will only be tied to your carrier if you choose carrier financing from at&t or verizon.

differences between an iphone for at&t or t-mobile and an iphone for sprint or verizon?                                                     iphone offers the same innovative features regardless of the wireless carrier you choose. if you choose at&t or t-mobile as your wireless carrier  your iphone will use either 3g or 4g lte cellular technology for data services and voice services. iphone can roam internationally on many gsm carriers around the world. if you buy an iphone with at&t or t-mobile  it will not work if you switch to sprint or verizon.  if you choose sprint or verizon as your wireless carrier  your iphone will use cdma cellular technology for voice and data services. if you buy an iphone with sprint or verizon  it will work on at&t or t-mobile. an iphone activated on sprint or verizon also has the ability to roam internationally on gsm networks. for details on lte network support  please see www.apple.com/iphone/lte.

airpods work with iphone 6s?  or only with the new iphone 7?   asked by kristen b from fresh meadows    on sep 9  2016     best answer:  the airpods will be able to pair the old fashioned way via bluetooth pairing to any bluetooth 4.0 de the airpods will be able to pair the old fashioned way via bluetooth pairing to any bluetooth 4.0 device  so as long as you have a device that's compatible with bluetooth 4.0 stereo headphones  the airpods will be able to work with it.  if you have an apple device capable of pairing using the w1 chip  then that's great  but you don't *need* one of those devices to pair with the airpods. if you're a rebel  you can even pair them to a samsung galaxy s7 or an htc 10 phone.   more(read full answer)      answered by paul r from noblesville    on oct 29

what ever the percentage   asked by peter h from kent    on apr 11  2018      answer now(can you charge the  iphone anytime  what ever the percentage)  2 answers(can you charge the  iphone anytime  what ever the percentage)        see all 2486 questions                 available space is less and varies due to many factors. a standard configuration uses approximately 8gb to 11gb of space (including ios and preinstalled apps) depending on the model and settings. preinstalled apps use about 4gb  and you can delete these apps and restore them. the high-gloss finish of the jet black iphone 7 is achieved through a precision nine-step anodization and polishing process. its surface is equally as hard as other anodized apple products; however  its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use. if you are concerned about this  we suggest you use one of the many cases available to protect your iphone.  †offer only available on presentation of a valid

lte support  contact your carrier and see www.apple.com/iphone/lte. cellular technology support is based on iphone model number and configuration for either cdma or gsm networks.   the high-gloss finish of the jet black iphone 7 is achieved through a precision nine-step anodization and polishing process. its surface is equally as hard as other anodized apple products; however  its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use. if you are concerned about this  we suggest you use one of the many cases available to protect your iphone. available space is less and varies due to many factors. a standard configuration uses approximately 8gb to 11gb of space (including ios and preinstalled apps) depending on the model and settings. preinstalled apps use about 4gb  and you can delete these apps and restore them. size and weight vary by configuration and manufacturing process. iphone 7 and iphone 7 plus are splash  water  and dust resistant and were tested under controlled laboratory conditions with a rating of ip67 under iec standard 60529. splash  water  and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. do not

                                                           when i buy an iphone from apple.com  is it tied to a carrier or does it come “unlocked”?                                                                                                         nearly all iphone models sold on apple.com are “unlocked” — which means your iphone isn’t tied to a single carrier. your iphone will be locked to your carrier only if you choose carrier financing from at&t or verizon.                                                                                                  what does “sim-free” mean?                                                                                                         “sim-free” means your iphone doesn’t ship with a carrier sim card. the sim-free iphone sold on apple.com and at the apple store is unlocked. that means you’re free to use a sim card from any carrier that provides service for iphone.                                                                                                  which capacity is right for me?                                                                                                         iphone 6s and iphone 6s plus come in two capacities: 32gb and 128gb. the term “gb“ stands for gigabytes. the more gigabytes you have  the more content you can store on your iphone  such as apps  games  photos  hd videos  music  and movies. if you have a large music or photo library or lots of apps  it’s a good idea to consider an iphone with a larger capacity. if you rarely download apps or you don’t take many photos or videos  an iphone with a smaller capacity may be better for you.                                                                                                  when i buy from apple.com  does my iphone come ready to use?                                                     if you completed the carrier activation steps for at&t  sprint  or verizon when you purchased your new iphone online  it will arrive ready to use. just turn it on and follow the onscreen instructions to set it up. if you chose to skip carrier activation at the time of purchase  you’ll need to insert an active sim card

your iphone. if you selected the sim-free iphone  you’ll need to insert your own nano-sim card or obtain one from the supported carrier of your choice and activate it in order to use your iphone.

    best answer:  the airpods will be able to pair the old fashioned way via bluetooth pairing to any bluetooth 4.0 de the airpods will be able to pair the old fashioned way via bluetooth pairing to any bluetooth 4.0 device  so as long as you have a device that's compatible with bluetooth 4.0 stereo headphones  the airpods will be able to work with it.  if you have an apple device capable of pairing using the w1 chip  then that's great  but you don't *need* one of those devices to pair with the airpods. if you're a rebel  you can even pair them to a samsung galaxy s7 or an htc 10 phone.

field in real time redmi pro combines two parallel lenses  each with its own sensor  for dslr-quality depth of field. the 13mp sony imx 258 sensor captures still images while the 5mp samsung sensor captures depth information. images are then processed by depth of field technology. all you have to do is snap a photo and select your preferred depth of field after.                 the world on a 10-core processor is as swift as a gust of wind.   liu hao ran          helio x2510-core processor while everyone else is discussing how fast octa-core processors are  redmi pro has moved on to a 10-core processor. with a 2.5ghz max clock speed  89% higher processing speeds  and 180% higher graphics performance  redmi pro is fast and responsive in just about everything - from launching apps to intensive gameplay. you’d think with this increase in performance  battery life would suffer. but it doesn’t. thanks to mediatek’s tri-cluster cpu architecture and it’s intelligent distribution and workload allocation. not only is overall power consumption reduced by 30%  overall phone performance is also more fluid and energy efficient.    +180% graphics performance  mali-t760 mali-t880    +89%

of traditional backlit panels  the oled display illuminates individual pixels on the screen  generating deeper blacks  brighter whites. the display has 100% ntsc which delivers 38% higher color gamut than the average smartphone. together with our built-in automatic color adjustment algorithm  everything you see on screen is incredibly vivid and true to life.         brushed aluminum body although many phone manufacturers use metal as a primary choice of material  smartphones still feel differently in hand. instead of giving redmi pro a typical mixed metal chassis  we’d crafted the metal body from a single block of aluminium. it doesn’t just look great  it feels great in your hand too. to achieve a premium texture and appearance  we added hairline brush strokes across the body and outer chamfered edges are cut using a 10-step diamond cutting technology. the result is a distinctive  elegant finish on redmi pro.                4050mah battery the 4050mah high-capacity battery  combined with 10 power-saving optimizations  deliver outstanding battery life on redmi pro. perfect for watching back-to-back episodes of your favorite tv show.   fingerprint sensor the front fingerprint

what we were paying at cricket..the rest was for taxes and fees..no hassles was a smooth transition..our new phones are amazing...we are very happy... date published: 2018-03-09                  rated

         rated 4 out of             5  by         alanhouston from         a nice small phone i wanted a small and light phone and  in 2018  the aristo 2 is smaller and lighter than most phones.  i like its simple style and black finish which looks good with a black case.  the aristo 2 is a basic phone for phone calls  texting and emails and it does those things well.  it lacks the processing muscle needed for advanced games so some games may have have issues.  lg provides its own lg home page which i found difficult/impossible to use.  then i found that the traditional android home page which includes the app drawer was an option in the display settings.  i then downloaded the 140 page pdf owner's manual which explains the many unique features of the aristo 2.  i like being able to just tap the screen to turn it off and on.  the auto brightness setting keeps the screen a bit dim to preserve the battery.  outdoors i use the manual brightness slider to get a brighter screen.  battery life is adequate for a 12 hour day for just making phone calls and texting.  netflix videos and gps navigation can drain the battery in three or four hours.  charging from 20% to 100% takes about two hours while the phone is still powered on.  the rear camera focuses quickly and takes good photos outdoors and takes okay photos indoors with the flash turned off.  the colors and contrast may be a bit muted compared with $700 flagship phones but people look good due to natural looking skin tones.  voices are clear using the rear speaker but music sounds a bit thin due to lack of bass.

became interested in testing a lower end phone to compare. yes  the s8+ is much better in all factors but this phone does not disappoint at all. only a hickup on occasion but that could be networking issues. it's a solid phone and now my main phone which saves me a ton when buying a new flagship phone outright! no finger print sensor is a bummer though but it's not a deal breaker. i work in software/hardware development and this phone is great for the price even for a phone expert like me ;) sold my s8+ and got 3 of these for my family. no complaints yet. i would  recommend this to a

rose gold (at&t)sportsinger75rating: 5 out of 5 stars5the best phone on the market. period.posted 1 year agoi will start by stating that i usually don't take the time to write reviews for products  but after using this phone since launch day  i felt compelled to let everyone know my thoughts.  i've used basically every ""big"" phone (pun intended) on the market  including the likes of the galaxy note 7  the s7 edge  lg g5  etc. though on paper the majority of these phones have slightly better specs than the new iphones  they don't hold a candle in comparison. for example  my experience on samsung phones as of late has been terrible  with poor software optimization to the point that the phone just crawls in performance doing pretty much any task. my experience with lg and motorola's phones were significantly better  probably due to the better software optimization of android  but nothing gets close to the buttery smooth performance of the new iphone. let's run down some of the key features of the iphone 7 plus specifically  with my thoughts on each one:  display: the display on this phone is incredible. regardless of the fact that it still has a 1080p display  it has the best color reproduction of any major phone out right now. not only that  but the screen incorporates the same color optimizing technology included on the new ipad pro 9.7""  which is to say that the color adjusts to your surroundings and lighting conditions.   speakers: the inclusion of stereo speakers on the new iphones is really great  especially for conference calls. watching videos is a much more enjoyable experience  though these speakers aren't going to replace your top of the line bluetooth speakers when playing your favorite music.  camera: the camera on the 7 plus is really something else. it uses a dual camera system for better zooming  which is a nice feature. the camera is also the best in low light situations that i've ever seen out of a phone  which is probably due to both the optics and the quad-led flash. photos are crisp and true to color during favorable lighting conditions.   home button: well  here's the thing...it doesn't have one. really  though  apple did place it's touch id sensor that looks like a home button in the same place they always have  it just doesn't move anymore. instead  it uses apple's force touch technology to give haptic feedback when you press it  which feels really nice. it takes about a day to get used to  but going back to physical home buttons after this feels very...clumsy.   performance: this phone flies. seriously  it's faster than some of the macbooks from recent years as far as raw processing power goes  with apple's a10 chip balancing both performance and battery saving into one monster combination.   battery life: the iphone 6s plus had really fantastic battery life  and the 7 is no different. in fact  it's even better this year. in day to day use  i've only had to charge this thing twice in 4 days. that's pretty incredible  and comes in handy when you don't have a charger near you.   that about wraps its up....wait! yeah  you know that missing headphone jack that everyone is upset about? it's not really a big deal. probably the biggest downside is that you can't listen to music and charge your phone at the same time unless you're using bluetooth headphones  but apple includes a headphone adapter in the box along with the phone  so the transition is pretty easy.   buy this phone  you won't regret it! i would  recommend this to a friendhelpful ( 112 )unhelpful ( 34 )report sorry  there was a problem.

fast  screen is very good  good battery life  ios 10 is great also.  if you want a total experience of great phone which works all the time without hangups this the phone to get  don't get hung up

unbelievable. i would  recommend this to a friendhelpful ( 40 )unhelpful ( 12 )report sorry  there was a problem.  please try again later.post commentacadiusrating: 4 out of 5 stars4the same with more.posted 1 year agoi've been a longtime iphone user since it's introduction in 2007.  i graduated from the iphone 6 plus to the 7 plus.  let me say that having this phone be water resistant is amazing! i've actually had this phone in the pool for short periods of time. i also don't worry when i am in the rain  taking pictures with it.  the haptic feedback is comforting in a weird way and i wonder how we managed without it this far. i know there was controversy with the removal of the headphone jack. i will admit  i wasn't a fan of that either since i have expensive headsets myself. however  the small adapter for the lighting jack that comes with the phone works fine and it seems that it'll last a while. i have yet to open my ear pods that came with the phone so i can't justly comment on those.  most of the changes with this phone come with the operating system. sure  most changes can be seen on the iphone 6s when you update the ios but there are other changes that can only be seen with the iphone 7. the battery lasts for a very long time to which where my worry of not being able to charge while using headphones hasn't been an issue.  this iphone doesn't reinvent the wheel with its subtle changes but like an old friend  it's dependable and familiar when you need it to be. i would  recommend this to a friendhelpful ( 26 )unhelpful ( 0 )report sorry  there was a

with the recall of the note 7  it left me stuck between a rock and a hard place. with extensive research  the iphone 7 plus is the next best thing. it's a beautifully crafted phone with no shortcuts. the phone is fast  stylish and everything i was needing to help me get over the samsung fiasco. the missing head jack is no big deal for me as i have wireless headphones. i would definitely recommend this phone for those on the fence of jumping from android to apple. i would  recommend this to a friendhelpful ( 25 )unhelpful ( 3 )report sorry  there was a problem.  please try again later.show

day 1 and i am really happy.  i had the 6 plus and 6s plus and the 7plus is the best  don't let reviews fool you that these is the same 3 year old iphone because it is not. the black mate color is nice and completely different from the space gray or previews generations black. it is water and dust resistant and it has a really good completely new dual lens camera. the speakers are the best  now you don't have to worry about the position of the phone or where to put your fingers to not block the audio coming out from the 1 speaker from previews generations. the speed  functionality and durability are the best you will not be disappointed. so yes these is a new iphone i would  recommend this to a friendhelpful ( 28 )unhelpful ( 11 )report sorry  there was a problem.  please try again

thanks to faster ssds and turbo boost processing up to 3.6ghz.               we squeezed the most into it. and out of it. each component inside macbook has been meticulously designed to get the most out of an incredibly thin and light enclosure. we chose powerful yet highly efficient processors  and optimized macos to draw on the processor using as little power as possible. because no fan is needed to cool the computer  it has more room for battery cells to support you on the go  all day long.           up to 20% faster performance     up to 3.6ghz turbo boost processing      processor

take on all sorts of tasks.      fanless architecture macbook was built for virtually silent performance. its processor runs on just 5 watts of power  which generates less heat and eliminates the need for a fan to cool the computer. instead  the logic board is seated on an anisotropic graphite sheet that helps disperse any heat. so you won’t hear a thing while your macbook is hard at work.

name hero                      scroll to continue      change            mac has always been built around a singular vision:  to create machines that are as powerful and functional as they are beautiful and intuitive. mac pro is a stunning realization of that ideal. all the elements that define a pro computer — graphics  storage  expansion  processing power  and memory — have been rethought and reengineered.  so you have the power and performance to bring your biggest ideas to life.      power            engineered around workstation graphics with dual gpus  pcie-based ssd storage  high-performance thunderbolt 2  xeon processors  fast memory  and support for 4k video  mac pro delivers brilliant performance across the board.      processor         up to  pcie bandwidth   up to  processing power                     mac pro is muscle through and through  starting with the intel xeon e5  available with 6  8  or 12 cores of processing power on a single die. and with up to 30mb of l3 cache  40gb/s of pci express gen 3 bandwidth  and 256-bit-wide floating-point instructions  you’ll never be at a loss for speed.      memory          memory standard   expandable up to  memory                     every component in mac pro is optimized for performance. that includes a four-channel ddr3 memory controller running at 1866mhz. it supports up to 64gb of memory and delivers up to 60gb/s of memory bandwidth  which means you can fly through even the most compute-intensive tasks in no time. and since it’s ecc memory  your render job  video export  or simulation won’t be stopped by transient memory errors.       graphics         up to  of gddr5 vram   up to  teraflops of computing power                     traditionally  pro computers have relied primarily on the cpu for their computing power. but as gpu performance has dramatically increased  software developers have begun to leverage that power in their apps. with mac pro  we looked ahead and engineered an even more powerful gpu architecture. not only does it feature an amd firepro workstation-class gpu — it features two of them. and each is available with up to 6gb of dedicated vram with up to 2048 stream processors. with all that power  you’ll be able to do things like seamlessly edit full-resolution 4k video while simultaneously rendering effects in the background — and still have enough power to connect up to three high-resolution 5k displays.      storage             up to      up to  faster than sata solid‑state drive           pcie ssd storage1200mb/s    sata ssd500mb/s    sata hard drive110mb/s                pci express–based ssd storage is fast — up to 2.4 times faster than the fastest sata-based solid-state drive and up to 10 times faster than a 7200-rpm sata hard drive. most ssd storage systems connect via sata buses designed for slower spinning hard drives. but we designed mac pro around pcie-based ssd controller technology to deliver the fastest solid-state drives available standard in a desktop computer. so you’ll have up to 1tb of storage that will let you boot up  launch apps  and even open massive files in  well  a flash.      thermal            mac pro packs an unprecedented amount of power in an unthinkable amount of space. a big reason we were able to do that is the ingenious unified thermal core. rather than using multiple heat sinks and fans to cool the processor and graphics cards  we built everything around a single piece of extruded aluminum designed to maximize airflow as well as thermal capacity. it works by conducting heat away from the cpu and gpus and distributing that heat uniformly across the core. that way  if one processor isn’t working as hard as the others  the extra thermal capacity can be shared efficiently among them. no computer has been built this way before. and yet it makes so much sense  it’s now hard to imagine building one any other way.      fan                   top      bottom                  previous mac pro           mac pro                  an incredible amount of innovation went into designing a fan system capable of cooling such a high-performance device. instead of adding extra fans  we engineered a single  larger fan that pulls air upward through a bottom intake. as air passes vertically through the center of the device  it absorbs heat and carries it out the top. it’s simple and elegant — and also astonishingly quiet. to achieve that  we had to consider every detail: the number of blades  the size of the blades  the spacing of the blades  and even the shape of the blades. by minimizing air resistance throughout the system  we were able to design a fan with backward-curved impeller blades that runs at fewer revolutions per minute  draws air more efficiently as it spins  and creates considerably less noise.      expansion            in creating mac pro  we wanted to provide an enormous amount of expansion — without being limited to the space inside the enclosure. designed with built-in thunderbolt 2  usb 3  gigabit ethernet  and hdmi 1.4 ports  mac pro has everything you need to build a workstation completely customized to what you need and how you work.      thunderbolt        up to  data transfer speeds   up to  faster than firewire 800       daisy-chain up to  devices   connect up to three  displays           thunderbolt combines pci express and displayport into one high-speed  versatile i/o technology. thunderbolt 2 delivers twice the throughput of thunderbolt  providing up to 20gb/s of bandwidth to each external device. so you can connect high-performance peripherals without being limited by the number of expansion slots inside your computer. you can connect massive amounts of storage  add a pci expansion chassis  and work with the latest external displays — including 4k and 5k desktop displays and peripheral devices capable of broadcast monitoring 4k video. and since each thunderbolt 2 port allows you to daisy-chain up to six peripherals  you can go all out by plugging in up to 36 external devices via thunderbolt 2 alone.     static part    up to  data transfer speeds   up to  faster than firewire 800   connect up to three  displays   daisy-chain up to  devices     io                                mac pro equips you with all kinds of connections for all kinds of peripherals. usb 3 gives you the versatility to hook up dozens of different types of external devices. two gigabit ethernet ports let you connect to multiple networks. and an hdmi 1.4 port provides support for the latest televisions  projectors  and displays  including ultra hd tvs. but the thought we put into expandability extends beyond the types of peripherals you can use. as you rotate mac pro to plug in a device  it senses the movement and automatically illuminates the i/o panel. so you can easily see the ports you need when you need them.                    wireless                           access your network over three-stream 802.11ac wi-fi for the latest in high-speed wireless connectivity. for all your other wireless connections  mac pro includes bluetooth 4.0. it’s the easiest way to connect your keyboard  mouse  and other wireless devices without having to physically attach anything.      measurements        9.9”           6.6”             design            mac pro looks unlike any other computer. because it is unlike any other computer. by rethinking the architecture of its internal components  we had the chance to rethink the entire enclosure. and since everything centers around a unified thermal core  we were free to design a much leaner  lighter  quieter  and far more streamlined structure. its unique design and beautiful finishes are executed to an extraordinary degree of precision. and at just 9.9 inches tall with a diameter of just 6.6 inches  it’s a pro desktop computer that can actually sit on your desk.      assembly             mac pro is a breakthrough in every way. including how it's manufactured. watch the video        a triangular thermal core formed using advanced extrusion techniques and precision machining allows for a more compact design and higher thermal efficiency.    refined impact extrusion technologies are more material-efficient and give the polished aluminum enclosure its incredible shape and finish.           with mac pro  we assemble the entire product and machine several of its high-precision components in the united states. by leveraging the innovative power of industry-leading companies in texas  florida  illinois  kentucky  and over a dozen other

smart oled tv w/ ai thinq&reg; - 55&quot; class (54.6&quot; diag)  model # oled55e8pua is not a &quot;picture-on-wall&quot; design. it is a &quot;glass design&quot;. our lg signature oled tvs  like

picture the oled or lcd??   -    i have heard that the oled has a slightly softer picture. thank you  videonut            asked by: videonut              i think what you are refering to is static resolution and it might be that lcd televisions are superior in that respect. however  tv's generally show moving images and then oled is far superior to lcd technology in so called motion resolution tests (like plasma was before oled came to market). if you can afford oled  don't even bother checking out lcd unless you want to watch tv in a very bright room or even outside  because that is about the only area where lcd is still superior: maximum brightness.             answered by: grrrrrene date published: 2018-03-31                 is it 3d like my current e6 oled?            asked by:

oled65e8pua or the new 2018 oled tvs  but from announcements made at ces2018  they will will feature control4&reg; simple device discovery protocol (sddp) technology. the integration enables lg to

(alpha) 7 for the lg oled b8.) lg was one of the last two 3d tv manufacturers to stop making 3d tvs and they made an announcement at ces that they would stop making 3d tvs which is why there weren't any 2017 models that featured 3d and there won't be any 2018 models that feature 3d. there are numerous articles online that you can read about the demise of 3d tvs and why tv manufacturers are not

pleased with everything.  the dishwasher has settings for every situation you may have or you can just push the button for ""auto"" and the machine will sense the size of the load and determine how to clean your dishes.  it has plenty of room and has adjustable racks to fit anything. sweepstakes entry received for review.          kturley 2 months ago nice build quality - very quiet 1 month using it  very quiet  definitely need to pre-rinse dishes. very nice build quality and finish. features are a bit complex. always find my self choosing the stronger water spray setting as it defaults to medium. i do wish it had a heater to better dry the dishes after wash. but overall cleans well and has a very good capacity. sweepstakes entry received for review.          mrlirr 2 months ago a great cleaner i wife and i find the lg to be a excellent machine very quiet but we do have one complaint it appears that when we push the bottom rack into the dishwasher it often goes off the track which then becomes a problem because we have to lift up the heavy rock and try and get it back on track we also are not content with the way the times fold down very easily making it often hard to use when you want them in the upright position other than that it does clean great and it is very quiet sweepstakes entry received for review.    link to product page          read more about this product

me. it really did. its super quiet and does what it is intended to do. it looks amazing in my home and when it finishes a cycle it sings in my kitchen. lg this black stainless was brilliant. well done

and is easy to use sweepstakes entry received for review.    link to product page          read more about this product           sshumaker3 3 years ago super quiet we bought this dishwasher several months ago and it is amazing. we love the ability to change the size of the silverware holders and the arrangement of the shelves. what we really love and appreciate is how quiet it is. you can barely hear it running at all and the loudest part is when it is draining water.          bconn 4 years ago good dishwasher lg lives up to its name of quality products. the only issue i have is that it doesn't signal whether the dishwasher is clean or dirty after it completes. other manufactures leave a light on when it completes its washing cycle.          ajdc 1 year ago fantastic dishwasher i installed the top control  dishwasher a month ago  and have been pleased beyond compare with the great cleaning this dishwasher performs on our dirty dishes. the top controls are convenient  and enhance the aesthetics of this beautiful appliance. also  the controls are out of the way  and are not accidentally accidentally pressed  which was a common occurrence with our old unit. we couldn't be happier with our new lg top control dishwasher! sweepstakes entry received for review.    link to product page          read more about this product           jacks mom 2 days ago great features i like. we bought this dishwasher towards the end of march. we are delighted with this purchase. we paid for the installation from home depot and were very happy with that. the dishwasher is super quiet and dries very well  plus it cleans very well.  there are more options on this washer  so i keep my product booklet handy  so i can choose whatever cycle type i want.  it matches my other lg appliances quite nicely. i have no regrets purchasing this machine. sweepstakes entry received for review.          mmtt 3 weeks ago cleans great and quiet i've been using this for two weeks or so.  it cleans better than any dishwasher i've had before.  it is quiet  but not silent.  i saved a mini my rack from my old dishwasher that i lay at the bottom side of the top rack that i can lay knives and other large/long utensils without worrying about them falling through.  (my model does not have the third rack).  initially i had problems b/c i didn't realize it closed w/a ""click"".  there is no latch or lever or other indication that the door has

doesn't cause problems over time.  sweepstakes entry received for review.          hppylg 1 day ago great for our needs we bought this because our old dishwasher (very old) worked fine  but the configuration did not allow us to put in many dishes.  we've only had it almost 2 weeks and have only had to run it twice - because you can load it completely full and everything comes out clean!  we've only tried the ""normal"" setting and are as happy as can be. sweepstakes entry received for review.    link to product page          read more about this product           earl8874 4 years ago dishwasher quietness quietness is the very 1st noticeable feature you come to appreciate  you can hear the water leaving and going into the dishwasher  but that is it. it does a great job of cleaning. your true steam technology really helps out on keeping my glassware and dishes coming out of the dishwasher very clear and clean in comparison to my old dishwasher. this makes everything worth the price. after about a month of usage  some cycles of cleaning appear to be long  (i am still in my learning curve of what                     ... read more  this dishwasher can do). before  i normally started the dishwasher before i went to sleep or left the house in the past  but now i can now run the dishwasher and not be disturbed at any time. you could talk or work around dishwasher and not realize the dishwasher is running. the design is very well thought out  and the look is very stylish in stainless steel. the door is recessed to allow more basket room. the countdown timer on the top of the door is easy to read. i really love the chime to alert you the cycle is finished. i would highly recommend this dishwasher to any or many people  you will not regret this purchase.           anonymous 3 years ago very quiet and awesome value! i absolutely love this dishwasher! it's positively the quietest dishwasher i have ever ""heard."" we bought this a set to upgrade our kitchen  and i haven't a complaint about it yet. i have never had an issue with dishes coming out dirty. it does take some learning on the settings but once you figure them out  it makes a dishwasher that will last for many years to come! it is very stylish and makes our kitchen look very fancy at a fancy low cost. i have had many  many compliments on it and have                     ... read more  even had people ask me where they can buy one just like it. i highly recommend this dishwasher  not only for how quiet it is  but because it does the best job on cleaning.           hr happy 8 months ago

mythias001 7 months ago great all around package!! when i first saw the price of an oled tv i was in sticker shock for a while  but after learning all of the tv's capabilities it truly started to look like a smart buy (or what i call future proof). i play games and watch 4k movies and am amazed at just how awesome everything looks. contrast between blacks and whites are unreal (because each pixle is its own light source). gaming lag is unoticable to me. i did a lot of research and this tv kept coming out on top. you will it be disappointed.... sweepstakes entry received for review.          thomas george 1 month ago a great television a very nice tv.  the picture is excellent and easy to set up.  the remote is very easy to use and functional.  lg customer service is easy to get through without long waits.  friendly and helpful.  a premium brand and television by lg.  lg makes their own panels for the oled technology and for other brands.  a top notch television.          jpryb 2 months ago great picture  wonderful tv i bought this a month ago for a full upgrade to my existing 42 inch tv and specifically get a 4k tv.  after doing thorough research i settled on this model and could not be happier.  between the perfect black  hdr  4k and apps available i now find myself wondering why i didn't purchase this sooner.  highly recommend. sweepstakes entry received for review.

that is no longer relevant. lg will be remembered as the company who invented the first ever real quality tv  hands down. buy one and stop thinking about buying one  you will be the happiest person in

ago the best picture of any tv i have every owned!! the best picture of any tv i have every owned and i have owned over 30 different types and makes of tv's.  i was recently able to compare this oled next to the competitors qled and the oled is at least 200% better even though most sales people will try and tell you the qled is almost the same.  don't believe it  the oled blacks are deeper and the colors are substantially more vibrant than the competitors.  they are no more competition than a 1st grade baseball player would be to a professional baseball player. sweepstakes entry received for

wasn't a factor. i'm glad i chose this.there aren't really any other words to say about this than wow! on every level this is truly amazing. i'm also glad i spent the extra $$ for this model that has the sound bar attached because i did not want to spend money on a surround sound system. it was definitely worth paying the extra $$ for if you can because it sounds amazing.there

7 months ago my best purchase yet i bought it for christmas 2016 after researching many different brands/tvs. 9 months later i couldn't be happier with my purchase. the pic is great. oled by far was the way to go. getting the 3d with the curved was screen was just an added bonus over the flat version. i have really no complaints about this tv. i wish i had another for my bedroom. sweepstakes

optionsportable  powerful and easy-to-use  tablets let you enjoy your favorite entertainment nearly anywhere. the ipad is one of many tablet brands available at best buy. it might be the ideal choice if you already have a mac or iphone because it uses the same operating system  apple ios. this means you can access your calendar  contacts  music from itunes and more on the ipad  too. if you're a new tablet user  ipad is still a great option because ios is considered intuitive. it's easy to download content from the huge selection of apps  games  music  books and movies within the apple app store. a popular  convenient feature of most ipad models is the voice-activated assistant  siri  which can send messages  set reminders and more. there are various models to meet your needs. small enough to hold in one hand but still powerful  the ipad mini is perfect for web browsing  making video calls  snapping and storing photos  reading books and more. the ipad air is larger than the ipad mini and designed to better handle apps for creativity and productivity. the ipad pro has a large  incredibly high-resolution display and delivers the power of a personal computer so you can work and play with ease. if you're still unsure which device is right for you  you can compare ipads and tablets.connectivityto access the internet on a tablet  you need to be within a wi-fi signal or hotspot. ipad models come with either wi-fi or wi-fi + cellular capability. wi-fi models are best if you plan to use your ipad where free  reliable wi-fi is available. however  if you travel frequently and it's hard to find public wi-fi  you might also want to purchase a mobile hotspot. mobile hotspots let you wirelessly connect multiple devices to the internet wherever you go. with a wi-fi + cellular ipad  you can add the device to your cellular carrier's data plan for 4g or 4g lte high-speed internet access. each of these options has different costs associated with it  so identify where you'll use the ipad to determine the most affordable way to stay connected.ipad accessoriesbest buy offers a wide range of accessories  including ipad chargers  headphones  cases  screen protectors and more.

standard. it's not just brighter and less reflective  it's far more responsive than anything that's come before. whether you're scrolling through pages in safari or playing an intense 3d game  everything feels utterly smooth  fast and immersive.        the new 10.5-inch ipad pro comes with a screen nearly 20% larger than the 9.7-inch model  so you get more room to do more1. it also delivers a full-size onscreen keyboard. yet it's just as portable as ever.           the new ipad pro retina display now supports a 120hz refresh rate. so movies and videos look spectacular  while games play smoothly without distracting artifacts. fast  it turns out  is incredibly beautiful. and however you use the display — with your finger or apple pencil — everything will feel more responsive2.           enhanced brightness makes it easier than ever to see wherever you are.    with a wide p3 color gamut  you get more vibrant greens and reds for truer-to-life images and videos.    apple's custom-designed antireflective coating makes the display clearer and more readable wherever you take your ipad.      end / section 2a   section 2b        .section2b img:not(.multitasking) {

customer reviewsaveragejoerating: 5 out of 5 stars5budget soundbar that sounds more expensiveposted 8 months agocontext: have a sonos play1  bose mini soundlink ii  klipsch promedia 2.1 pc speaker set  zvox 450 for the bedroom tv - familiar with sound from different manufacturers.  pros:  - price point  purchased this as open box for ~40% off  making it the cheapest upgraded speakers so far.  - included wireless subwoofer enables placement anywhere - excellent for the living room space approx 12' x 12'  - mids and highs are good from the soundbar - polk sounded a lot better than jbl and lg soundbars on display - bass is just enough. not overbearing like klipsch or bose  cons:  - bluetooth connection is spotty after hours of play; best if device is within range and no wall interference - system takes a while to turn on - no volume or input type display on unit - remote could use more sensitivity  range  and weight  conclusion: great soundbar for the average person who isn't looking for ground-shaking bass and simply looking for an upgrade from the tinny tv speakers on most hdtv's today. most other speakers sounded a bit too focused on the mids and highs. the only other comparable one i found was the jbl cinema sb450  which is much more expensive.  audiophiles or those who enjoy sonos or other premium components will find that these soundbar is lacking in clarity on the mids and overall balanced sound. when compared to vizio or the lg/samsung soundbars that best buy carries  this blows them out of the water. i would  recommend this to a friendhelpful ( 60

to the 3 again  the deal was sealed  polk for the win. we couldn't be happier with our choice. it has the best sound and for a great price! i would  recommend this to a friendhelpful ( 20 )unhelpful (

like you are at the theater. the only thing i don't like about it is the volume on the remote control. hard to press and get it to where you want  often end up too loud and having to lower. not a big deal  but when others are sleeping it can wake them if you aren't careful. i would  recommend this to a friendhelpful ( 11 )unhelpful ( 0 )report sorry  there was a problem.  please try again

months agoafter always having family over and never being able to enjoy sports game or movies because of the low quality of speakers i decided to go and invest in a sound bar. by far one of the best decisions i have had. not only is the quality of the speakers amazing but being able to connect to different things with a click of a button has made this investment well worth it. i would  recommend

because this soundbar was more than the one i originally wanted  but with a toddler  i didn't want exposed speakers.   the sound is great  my toddler drives his hot wheels all over it and doesn't do any damage  and it's easy to use!  the only downside is sometimes the remote doesn't register and you have to click a few times for the volume to change. i would  recommend this to a friendhelpful ( 7

the laptop selection process is determining how you're going to use it. for casual use  like e-mail  surfing the web  paying bills and checking social media  you will likely be well-served by one of the lightest  cheapest laptops. if you ask a bit more from your laptop  like streaming and saving movies and music or using office software for tasks like spreadsheets and document creation  you'll want more hard drive storage. for multitasking with multiple tabs and programs  editing photos  producing videos  or playing video games  you'll not only want a large screen size  you'll want a laptop with a fast processor and lots of random access memory (ram). more laptop considerationsyou'll want to consider screen resolution — from hd  good for surfing the web  to 4k ultra hd  which creates the rich colors and images you want for gaming or editing. weight is also something to keep in mind. as you would expect  a larger screen and more capacity translates to more weight. streamlined options start at under 3 lbs.  with the best personal computer laptop for gamers usually weighing in at over 6 lbs. the heart of the laptop  the operating system  manages the software and hardware. you can choose from a pc laptop with microsoft windows  the most common laptop operating system; apple notebooks or laptops with apple mac osx  exclusive to macs; or the easy-to-use google chrome os. as for storage  mechanical hard disk drives (hdd) are common because they're relatively inexpensive and have huge capacities  while newer solid-state drives are faster  but offer less capacity. users who store photos  music and video in a cloud  and use web-based software instead of storing it on the device can get by with less storage. not gamers  though  who require big hdd space for large game files. laptop brands you'll lovechoosing the best laptop can be confusing due to the multiple options with overlapping features from a variety of brands. best buy offers laptop models from the brands
